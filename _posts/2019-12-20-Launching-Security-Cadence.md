title: "Launching Security Cadence"

While on the Security Weekly podcast I made the suggestion for organizations to set themselves a "Security Cadence".  A rhythm for migrating security changes into production.  
These changes can be big such as implementing 802.1x or very small such as setting host based firewalls to prevent a specific Windows binary from reaching the Internet.  The
whole point is give your organization momentum towards improving, while not getting overwhelmed by the and complexity of the task of "securing your organization".  Further,
a Security Cadence forces organizations to stay alert to current InfoSec events and to recognize that securing your organization is an on-going task with no finish line.  It
also forces organizations to focus on the technologies they already have available to them instead of always looking to third party vendors for solutions.  

Starting in January we will try to have a new security initiative published every two weeks.  That will be our Security Cadence.
