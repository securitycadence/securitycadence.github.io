title: Security Cadence

<h2>Do what now?</h2>
During a roundtable conversation on the Paul's Security Weekly podcast the topic of
how to help organizations to figure out how to start securing their infrastructures.
There are so many variables, so many attack surfaces, so many configurations buried
deep in our operating systems applications. It is easy to get overwhelmed and give
up. From the noise a suggestion was made: Organizations should adopt a Security Cadence.
<br>&nbsp;<Br>
<h2>What's a Security Cadence?</h2>
The idea is simple: Set a goal to migrate into production at least one security relevant
change every X amount of days. It could be one a week, one every other week, once a month...
Whatever makes sense and works for your organization. The point is to just keep moving
forward and getting better. The changes can be tiny like disabling a Windows service
that isn't necessary in your organization (LLMNR, anyone?) or it can be a big lift like
implementing 802.1x to prevent non-company owned systems from attaching to the corporate
network. As long as it has a positive impact to the security posture of your organization,
it counts!
<Br>&nbsp;<Br>
<h2>So what is this site for?</h2>
This site is a simple blog where we will at a regular cadence suggest new secuirty
initiatives that could be beneficial to organizations. Our plan is to publish a new
initiative at a cadence of one every other week. Each initiative will have an explanation
as to what is being suggested, why it helps improve security, how to accomplish it,
potential gotchas, and links to additional information. We will focus as much as possible
on security initiatives that can be accomplished for free in most organizations.

<h2>Tips...</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Perfection is the Enemy of Good:</li> Often when looking at a security initiative the
        knee-jerk reaction is to either state ways of defeating the initative or edge cases
        for why an initiative won't work in the organization. Security is about layers, not
        about being foolproof. For example, an initiative to enable workstation firewalls to
        block workstations from talking to other workstations will often cause headaches for
        service desk employees who need to remotely connect to end user systems. If you can
        find no other ways of accomodating this workflow, then put firewall exceptions in for
        the helpdesk systems. Blocking all workstation to workstation traffic is perfect. Blocking
        most workstation to workstation traffic is good. Blocking no workstation to workstation
        traffic is terrible. if you can't be perfct, at least be good.
      <li>Always Test:</li> We will do our best to provide warnings of gotchas for every initiative
      we suggest, but you have to know your own environment. Always test before you move forward.
      Do what Mr. Rogers taught us, and look for the helpers. Find people throughout your
      organization to act as your pilot group where you can push changes to first before migrating
      to the rest of your organization.
      <li>Stability is More Important Than Your Cadence:</li> If your change isn't ready for prime
      time then give yourself permission to push back your migration date. Don't put your business
      at risk just to keep up with your cadence. As a suggestion, instead of breaking your cadence,
      replace your weekly change with user awareness training. Emails, posters, lunch and learns, etc...
